# DutchBoy
### Know Your Customer

DutchBoy is a web application designed to help small business owners manage customer data more efficiently. It is a full-stack application that utilizes JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Tailwind for the frontend, providing the application with a modern look and feel. Data is stored in MongoDB, enabling easy scalability as the business grows and more customer data is collected. To ensure privacy, only authorized users can add customer details. Google's People API is employed to implement OAuth for authentication. Mongoose is used to access MongoDB in the terminal, setting up the schema and exporting the models.

The site is deployed using Heroku.
